                    While the majority of my middle school and high school
                    courses are a blur, I can vividly remember when my best
                    friend, who coincidentally also lives in Seattle, and I
                    filled a blank in our schedule with a Web Development class.
                    We were only introduced to the basics of HTML and CSS, but I
                    can remember the pride I felt building something with a
                    computer.

                <p className='about__text'>
                    Time went on and I applied to college with no idea what I
                    wanted to do with my life. I defaulted to finance and
                    economics, which I don't regret as my degree has provided me
                    with a steady income and the ability to work with hundreds
                    of founders and venture capitalists along the western coast
                    of the United States. Throughout college I spent my free
                    time taking introductory coding courses.

                <p className='about__text'>
                    Within a year of graduating college I knew I wanted to
                    commit myself to a career change.
                </p>

                <p className='about__text'>
                    I'm driven to change my career and will succeed in my
                    pursuit of knowledge and happiness.
